#HOWITWORKS
howitworks_text="
Welcome to Arcanum - the passwordtool.

This is the perfect place to save your password encrypted.

In this database, nothing will be stored in clear text. In example:

This is your mailaccount password: "great.password"
It will saved in the database encrypted: <b class='info'>"ùACB×0XÂîˆdÔRãÏ$ì"</b>

This stored encrypted password depends on your masterkey, which is generated from your own username and password.

That means, Arcanum is able to store all your passwords encrypted online.

And these are the security benefits of <b class='info'>Arcanum</b>:

1. If you change your password, all your data will be automatically re-encrypted.
2. Only your password can decrypt the database
3. There is no admin account in Arcanum, all users are equal
4. Because of this, there is no password reset function - Arcanum can show a password hint instead
5. Arcanum can only decrypt your data, if you are logged in!

This Arcanum this secure, as your password is!
